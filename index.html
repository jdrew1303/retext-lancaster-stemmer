        <h1>retext-lancaster-stemmer</h1>
        <p>A quick demo of <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/retext-lancaster-stemmer">retext-lancaster-stemmer</a>.</p>
        <p>Just paste (or write) some text in the text area below, and next to it the HTML version of the document will appear, where every word is colour coded to its stem.</p>
        <p>Please raise any issues on <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/retext-lancaster-stemmer/issues">Github</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Note!</strong> The generated colours are random (albeit generated from the actual stem): White colours might (will!) appear. Equal colours for different stems might also appear.</p>
        <textarea rows="20" cols="80" autofocus>Try it out. Just start typing. Itâ€™s pretty cool. A simple english sentence. In a paragraph.
Another sentence, in another paragraph.</textarea>
